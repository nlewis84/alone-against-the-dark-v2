    "description": "For you, Professor Louis Grunewald, this first day of September 1931 has been tiring and uncomfortable. Light mist has covered Arkham for most of the day. You held two uninspired undergraduate classes at Miskatonic University, and you met with the new chairman of the literature Department, a giddy Technocrat. You survey your desk and see that a stack of papers to grade has already formed. You’re enjoying your second pipe of the evening, and putting off grading papers, when the doorbell rings. To your surprise, it’s a telegraphic messenger.\n\n“It arrived at Kingspoint Head station not more than an hour ago,” the boy says.\n\nYou sign for it, and slip a dime into the youngster’s hand. “Oh, thank you, sir!” You open the envelope and scan the contents (see below).\n\nMy goodness, you think. Imagine! Dotty old Gliere in prison! You recall that he had gone to Greece to work on his book concerning primitive myths. What has he gotten himself into? Should you wire money? You recall all the amusing discussions you’ve had with him, and a sudden insight lets you understand that Tibor Gliere had no close friends except for you. Should you go help him? You suppose the University will grant you leave. But do you want to go?\n\nWith uncommon speed you decide to go to Athens to help Gliere. You write him a wire, and another to Ernest Holt, a wealthy New York financier and a good friend of yours. If you get into hot water, Holt will help, and so, you decide to keep him posted on your progress. You give both telegrams to the waiting messenger, along with the necessary funds.\n\nWhat to do now? You’ll go to the bank first thing in the morning to get travel funds. As for Trans-Atlantic schedules, well the Advertiser surely carries that information. As you pack, you wonder if you should check Gliere’s room at Mrs. Harding’s boarding house. Maybe you could get a clue about Gliere’s activities or a hint about his arrest.\n\nYour passport is in order; your clothes and sundries are packed. You’d best turn in. You’re going on a little trip. When you awake, it is Sept. 2.",

You babble a warning in English, supposing that the alarm alone in your voice will be enough to dissuade him from going closer to the horrors lurking in the Parthenon behind you.\n\nTo your surprise, he answers in English. His voice is slow, but it inspires your confidence. “Fear no more,” he says. “Tonight the stars themselves bind those things to the top of the sacred hill. We have nothing to fear here.”\n\nYour terror begins to lift like a veil. “Your friend was killed by one of those... creatures. You see them in museums, you know, looking like stuffed animals. Undead? Ghouls? Who knows their origin? Your friend Gliere saw them just before they killed him. That is as much as you and I need know.” He pauses. “Our lives we struggle in darkness. We are poor beings, who need the darkness in order to find the light.” As he says these words, the moon breaks through the clouds, and a calm beauty pervades the world. Your fears are quenched, your heart utterly at peace.\n\n“I have been on quests like yours. I have been a scholar of the unusual. I know the uncertainties and the terrors. There is nothing we mere mortals can do but strengthen our faith and struggle against the darkness.” The two of you walk slowly.\n\n“I do not know what Gliere had discovered. But I do know that while in prison he told someone that if the Karpathos Device was returned to its home, life as we know it will cease to exist.”\n\nHe turns to you, “I am at the end of my life. It is up to you to stop this evil, as your friend attempted so valiantly. Egypt is the answer. Go there, find the Karpathos Device, return it to the sea, or destroy it utterly.” He takes something from his hand. It is a ring, heavy with gold, curiously made, covered with signs, most prominently a five-pointed star with a core of flame. “I give you this. It has power, though perhaps not as much as you would want. Use it against dead things brought back to existence.”\n\nFor a moment a friendly hand has steadied you and restored your resolve. This warmth of feeling is what you fight for—and the numbing terror which chased you from the hill is what you despise.\n\nWhen you look up again, your new friend is gone. The road is empty. The encounter was like a dream. But the ring is still there. You slip it on a finger; it fits firmly and comfortably. Reaching the bottom of the hill, you find a cab and go to a hotel. You sleep peacefully.",

    "description": "As you turn to leave, the sargeant seems to remember something then hands over a piece of paper. Unfolding it, you recognize Gliere’s tiny, precise script. There is no date and no signature:\n\nDr. Louis Grunewald\nMiskatonic University\nArkham, Mass., U.S.A.\n\nDear Louis\n\nI fear it is too late for me. Though with the best of motives, the authorities foolishly apprehended me before I could accomplish destruction of the Karpathos Device, and thereby they have re-endangered the world. If, to prevent my further interference, the cult of Aten tries to murder me while I am trapped in this cell, I do not see how they can fail their purpose.\n\nThis letter, therefore, must convince you of the truth I tell and relate to you what must be done about it. You must do it or see that it is done, else our world is doomed.\n\nThough our discussions have acquainted you with some of what I now write, you have never accepted my arcane conclusions. I beg you now to do so, at least for the length of this letter. What follows is the situation, as I understand it.\n\nAn Alexandrian-era sorcerer, one Ephegon of Karpathos, was reputed to have constructed a mechanism perfectly replicating the movement of the spheres. According to certain fragmentary evidences, this device was to be sent to Egypt, to agents of the notorious cult of Aten. The record is dim. Perhaps it was designed in Egypt and built in Kerpathos, but I digress.\n\nOnce installed in Egypt, the mechanism could be used in a great ceremony presaging the end of the world. It would somehow align the forces of nature with the metaphysical powers of an unnamed, exceedingly evil god. The product of the ceremony would be another device, this one very simple: a crystal octahedron, which could be spun like a child’s top. It is the Top of Aten, a thing of as great magical power as the device which produced it was a wonder of natural science.\n\nBy bringing the Top of Aten “farthest south” to the “last city of the oldest beings,” and then summoning their god, the cult intended to use their cosmic gyro to alter the rotational axis of the Earth, thereby bringing a strange land (surely Antarctica) once more to life. In the process, the annoying “lands of the stick folk”—literally, the lands of men—would be destroyed.\n\nBut the ship carrying the device to Egypt was lost in a great storm, and then Ephegon died. The ceremony was never begun.\n\nYou’ll recall the mysteries surrounding the Miskatonic expedition to Antarctica, and its tragic outcome; and you know that the Starkweather-Moore expedition leaves Bremen this winter to return to Antarctica and reopen the terrible questions which Lake first raised. But have you heard of the Karpathos Device—the strange instrument recovered near the island of Karpathos? After examining it, I knew that this was Ephegon’s device!\n\nLouis, it is my firm conviction that this tale is true, that a great scheme to change the world has been reactivated by the cult of Aten. Perhaps they employed great magic to manipulate destiny, or perhaps they are exceedingly cunning and evaluate every event for what they may gain of it, but their hour has come round again.\n\nOthers also believe this. An erudite and cruel man named Stanford has lent me subtle aid, but says that for arcane reasons he may do no more: he is not a friend, but says that in this thing he serves his god! A kinder, gentler Greek gentleman has also helped. Both seem to represent greater powers than man, perhaps beyond our ken.\n\nBut the cult of Aten is strong. At least one among them is no man at all, but a …\n\nHere the letter ends. There is no second sheet. There is nothing on the reverse of the sheet.\n\nAs you struggle to digest and evaluate the letter, the guard casually informs you that nothing else of Gliere’s is now at the prison.",

You hear the sharp sound of releasing springs, and metal bands wrap around your arms and legs, holding you tight to the chair. There is nothing you can do!\n\nHow foolish you were to have trusted a strange man you’ve only just met.\n\nNow the heavy breather steps around so that you can see him clearly. You see dry, leathery skin, portions of which flake away as he moves. The eyes are hollow, inhuman. Hawkes sniggers, and introduces you to Achmed, who Hawkes says is nearly 3,000 years old, and who is very, very hungry. You are wild-eyed, and the sound of Hawkes’ maniacal laughter screams in your ears. Achmed’s mouth opens slowly, and he leans toward your helpless body. You see that his teeth are long, yellow, and very sharp. Your screams fill the room, but no one comes to save you. It is...\n\nTHE END.",

Now your kingdom shall be greater than Mu, greater than Atlantis, and and we … We shall be with you, not as mere servants but as lords.\" The man turns and faces the wall.\n\nThen you see the Karpathos Device, gleaming in the subdued light. The man touches the wall, and an opening appears, as dark as the pit to hell. The man inserts the Device, and the whole wall seems to part. A shaft of prismatic light arcs into the room, swirling around everyone. The man screams, and you see a glistening silver top appear, hovering in the air. As the top waits there, the man shakes and quivers with extraordinary violence. His flesh seems to melt from his bones until he becomes a horrifying mass of pulsating material. A sickening foul odor fills the room, while you hear mental messages again:\n\n\"Into the pit! The icy pit where the Old Ones lie!\"\n\"Into the pit! And once more all life must die!\"\n\"Where all is north, He will come forth.\"\n\"The top will spin, the Lord will grin!\"\n\"Into the pit! Into the pit! Into the pit!\"\n\nThe top is taken by the pulsating mass. The fleshy mass then begins to reform itself into a man, but a different, taller one. You can’t make him out. You do perceive that the top is to be taken somewhere, but now all you can understand is \"Starkweather-Moore.\"",
