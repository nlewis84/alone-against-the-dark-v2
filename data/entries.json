    "description": "For you, Professor Louis Grunewald, this first day of September 1931 has been tiring and uncomfortable. Light mist has covered Arkham for most of the day. You held two uninspired undergraduate classes at Miskatonic University, and you met with the new chairman of the literature Department, a giddy Technocrat. You survey your desk and see that a stack of papers to grade has already formed. You’re enjoying your second pipe of the evening, and putting off grading papers, when the doorbell rings. To your surprise, it’s a telegraphic messenger.\n\n“It arrived at Kingspoint Head station not more than an hour ago,” the boy says.\n\nYou sign for it, and slip a dime into the youngster’s hand. “Oh, thank you, sir!” You open the envelope and scan the contents (Handout: Dark 1, see page 12).\n\nMy goodness, you think. Imagine! Dotty old Gliere in prison! You recall that he had gone to Greece to work on his book concerning primitive myths. What has he gotten himself into? Should you wire money? You recall all the amusing discussions you’ve had with him, and a sudden insight lets you understand that Tibor Gliere had no close friends except for you. Should you go help him? You suppose the University will grant you leave. But do you want to go?\n\nWith uncommon speed you decide to go to Athens to help Gliere. You write him a wire, and another to Ernest Holt, a wealthy New York financier and a good friend of yours. If you get into hot water, Holt will help, and so, you decide to keep him posted on your progress. You give both telegrams to the waiting messenger, along with the necessary funds.\n\nWhat to do now? You’ll go to the bank first thing in the morning to get travel funds. As for Trans-Atlantic schedules, well the Advertiser surely carries that information. As you pack, you wonder if you should check Gliere’s room at Mrs. Harding’s boarding house. Maybe you could get a clue about Gliere’s activities or a hint about his arrest.\n\nYour passport is in order; your clothes and sundries are packed. You’d best turn in. You’re going on a little trip. When you awake, it is Sept. 2; go to 102.",

Grunewald hinted of mysteries beyond the capacities of mere assistants. You trust his judgment and decide to go yourself. You scrawl instructions to subordinates and dictate phone messages to a secretary whom you have callously woken from a sound sleep. Your holdings will tend themselves for a few weeks. Your passport is in order. You’ll pull strings to get an assortment of visas overnight: mere governments cannot keep Ernest Holt from aiding a friend. A liner sails soon. Jenkins can have you packed and ready to go in an hour. You have plenty of time. It’s a pity your experimental trans-Atlantic passenger plane isn’t quite ready, though that would be fun! You find yourself eagerly anticipating action in the field. You feel ready for anything. You call Lydia Lau at The New York Sun. A despicable rag of a newspaper, but a crackerjack young lady with lots of talent. Miss Lau has heard nothing from Grunewald. You notice her professional interest grow as you talk, and you ask her to write nothing for a few days. “I’m sure there’s a proper explanation,” you say grandly, but somehow you know that neither of you believes that statement.

With Gliere dead, and Holt and Grunewald missing, you’re pretty sure that the story behind this one will be a real jaw-dropper— and probably dangerous. Holt’s been missing for 72 hours. You thoughtfully pack the gigantic revolver given to you by Bruno the vice-squad cop. A girl can’t be too careful, you decide. You can leave soon on one of the regular liners, and in the meantime do some shopping and research—maybe even make a trip to Arkham. You send a telegram to your beau, Devon Wilson, aboard the USS Rochester, telling him your plans and that you’ll keep in touch.
